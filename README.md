Bring iOS 7's interface to Hangouts

Since Google, as of early 2014, decided not to care about the terrible UI of their Hangouts app, still using the iOS 6 legacy framework, I wrote this tweak to fix this.  


Known issues : 
Crazy layout margins bugs.
Can't work on first app load (have to find a way to hook main() or UIApplicationMain() using theos)
